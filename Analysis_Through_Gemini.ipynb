to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird but honestly love it like it or not this is the way the world is going so why not loved it so much ordered 2 didn get the show because it looks like it came from the 1990 and is downright ugly have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway so the spot screen does not bother me although it is very clear alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar where can just say play any song want and it will guess could just pick up my smartphone to do that but you don know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages the one thing that am not fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much they also do not rotate when playing music love for it to display the weather as listen to music the screen is clear and also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be there is great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places that you program and name so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic have this programmed for my parents fiances parents work and her work so it really works great the one thing that actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot the dot lights up colors why can the spot the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring just make that ring yellow when package is updated for delivery overall it great device that am looking forward to integrating my home around already looking at dash buttons smart plugs etc and when become home owner instead of renting where can tinker with my thermostat will be purchasing nest down the road for hvac

of being on the phone it still didn work this product has tested my patience so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to smart home to just kicking it old school the only reason gave
